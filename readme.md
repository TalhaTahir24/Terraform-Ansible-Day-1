ðŸŒŸ My Journey into Automation with Terraform and Ansible! ðŸŒŸ

For the past few days, Iâ€™ve been diving into Terraform and Ansible, and it has been an incredibly rewarding experience!

ðŸ”§ Creating Virtual Machines with Terraform:
I started by using Terraform to create virtual machines for my site. The process was so seamless that I was able to set up my infrastructure with just a few commands.

ðŸ¤– Ansible Playbooks:
Next, I embarked on automation with Ansible. By running manual playbooks, I installed Docker and updated the apt cache.

ðŸ”„ The Power of Automation:
Once I automated everything, I was amazed to see that the virtual machine could retrieve its own IP address! As soon as Terraform finished its job, the Ansible playbook ran automatically.

This journey has given me a fantastic opportunity to learn and grow, and Iâ€™m now ready to take my automation skills to the next level!

ðŸš€ Next Steps:
Moving forward, Iâ€™m excited to explore more advanced concepts and tools. The world of automation is vast, and Iâ€™m eager to dive deeper!
